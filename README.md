# Overview

## Setup Requirements

Before we begin, we need to collect all the config values we need to run the application:

- Account SID: Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this [in the console here](https://www.twilio.com/console).
- API Key SID: Used to authenticate - [generate one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/runtime/api-keys).
- API Key Secret: Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll get one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/runtime/api-keys).

### A Note on API Keys

When you generate an API key pair at the URLs above, your API Key Secret will only
be shown once - make sure to save this in a secure location,
or possibly your `~/.bash_profile`.

## Setting Up The Application

Create a configuration file for your application:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `.env` with the configuration parameters we gathered from above.

Next, we need to install our dependencies from npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running The Application

Now we should be all set! Run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You will
be prompted to test and choose your microphone and camera. On desktop browsers, your choices will
be saved. _On mobile browsers, you will be asked to test and choose your microphone and camera every
time you load the application in order to make sure they are not reserved by another application_.
